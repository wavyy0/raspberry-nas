            <h3>About my project</h3>
            <div class="mb-5">
                My project is a simple NAS (Network-attached Storage), based on Raspberry Pi 4B.
                Network-Attached Storage is a dedicated file storage system that connects to a network, allowing multiple users and devices to access and share data. It provides centralized storage, data redundancy, and remote accessibility, improving collaboration and backup solutions for your home network.
            </div>
            <h3>What will you need?</h3>
            <div>
                Well, it depends on your requirements for the NAS. Mine were pretty simple - just some convenient storage space for old photos and some documents, for two people. Here's a list of items that i used:
            </div>
            <ul class="mb-5">
                <li>
                    Raspberry Pi 4B 2GB - I had a JustPi kit (<a href="https://botland.com.pl/moduly-i-zestawy-raspberry-pi-4b/16491-zestaw-justpi-z-raspberry-pi-4b-wifi-2gb-ram-32gb-microsd-akcesoria-obudowa-z-dwoma-wentylatorami-5903351242578.html">link</a>), it comes with everything you need (Raspberry Pi itself, power supply, HDMI and Ethernet cables, and very neat ventilated case).
                </li>
                <li>
                    MicroSD card - JustPi kit that I used comes with MicroSD containing NOOBS installer, however I used another card and put the Raspbian image in it. My card is 64 GB, but 16 or 32 GB will also do the job.
                </li>
                <li>
                    USB Disk - I used a 128 GB USB Flash Drive, it's more than enough for my humble requirements.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <img class="w-100 mb-5" src="images/img1.jpg" alt="">
            <h3>Setting up the Pi</h3>
            <div class="mb-5">
                After installing and configuring Raspbian, I ran all updates and I inserted my USB Flash Drive. From now on, we can use use only SSH - it's way more convenient. You can connect to the Pi via SSH using hostname, however in my home router GUI, I specified a static IP for my Pi (192.168.1.180 in my case - picked an address outside of the DHCP Pool configured on my router).
            </div>
            <img class="text-center mx-auto d-block mb-3" src="images/img2.JPG" alt="">
            <div class="mb-3">
                Then, I installed Samba - it will be needed for sharing specified directory in our network.<br>
                <code>$ sudo apt install samba samba-common-bin</code>
            </div>
            <div class="mb-3">
                Next step, is to format the drive into ext4. Make sure, that you moved all important files from your drive, also remeber to unmount the drive.<br>
                <code>
                $ sudo umount /dev/sda1<br>
                $ sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1
                </code>
            </div>
            <div class="mb-5">
                After that, you can mount the drive again<br>
                <code>
                $ sudo mount /dev/sda1<br>
                </code>
                And add the following line at the end of fstab:<br>
                <code>
                /dev/sda1 /mnt/sda1/ ext4 defaults,noatime 0 1<br>
                </code>
            </div>
            <h3>Sharing dedicated folder</h3>
            <div class="mb-3">
                Now, we can create a directory that we want to share, path to mine is /mnt/sda1/shared, then grant rwx permissions for all users, to that directory.<br>
                We have our shared directory, so now let's share it. Add the following to the Samba config file:<br>
                <code>
                    [shared]<br>
                    path=/mnt/sda1/shared<br>
                    writeable=Yes<br>
                    create mask=0777<br>
                    directory mask=0777<br>
                    public=no<br>
                </code>
            </div>
            <div class="mb-3">
                If you're using iOS, you will also need to add the following to the <code>[global]</code> section of that file:<br>
                <code>
                    vfs objects = fruit streams_xattr<br>
                </code>
                And restart the smdb daemon.
            </div>
            <div class="mb-3">
                Time for the last step, we can now create users and set their smb passwords, that soon we will be logging with. If you want each user to have their own private folder, apart from the shared one, simply create the folder, change its owner and grant rwx permission only for the owner.
            </div>
            <div class="mb-5">
                It's time for testing.<br>
                On my iPhone, in the "Files" app, I clicked "Connect to server", typed address of my NAS (smb://{hostname}.local), provided credentials that I previously set, and I successfully connected. I sent some photos to the server to see if everything works fine, and it does.
            </div>

            <img class="mb-5 d-block mx-auto" src="images/img4.png" alt="">
            <div class="mb-5">
                Finally, after setting everything up and making sure that it works, it was time to fully assemble the cover that came in JustPi Kit. Stick thermal pads on the upper case, connect the little fans to GPIO pins 4 (red) and 6 (black), tight a few screws and it's done!
